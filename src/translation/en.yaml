      I'm a talented programmer with over 12 years of programming experience.


      I'm taking my Masters in Software Development at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Right now I'm doing an exchange semester at TUM in Munich, Germany. When I'm not in school, I'm working on projects for my customers and on my own [personal projects](/projekt).


      I love to learn new things and to challenge myself. I'm a quick learner, and I have no problems with having many balls in the air.


      Do you have a website or an app that needs to be created? Or do you need to streamline your business system? Feel free to [contact me](/kontakt) if you've got a job that fits my skills!
